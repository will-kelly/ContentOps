## Overview

Generative AI is a powerful tool for drafting technical and marketing content, but true thought leadership still relies on human expertise.  
This framework shows how to integrate a custom GPT into your white paper development process—while ensuring your voice and insights lead the way.

## Framework

### 1. Lay the Groundwork: Human-First Expertise Map
- Start with a detailed outline capturing your expertise, observations, and market insights.
- Mark critical sections (e.g., conclusions, strategic forecasts) as "human-only" zones.

> **Tip:** Your expertise should drive the narrative, not AI suggestions.

---

### 2. Develop or Customize a GPT/LLM for Research Assistance
- Train a lightweight custom GPT using your past writing samples.
- Fine-tune the model for plain language, practical examples, and minimal jargon.
- Use the custom GPT for:
  - Drafting background/context sections
  - Summarizing long technical sources
  - Structuring SME interview notes

---

### 3. Keep AI Use Transparent and Structured
- Internally tag AI-generated text for easy review and rewrite.
- Color-code, comment, or flag AI contributions during drafting.

---

### 4. Reality-Check Everything
- Manually fact-check AI-assisted outputs.
- Anchor all claims in current, reliable sources or firsthand experience.

> **Important:** Even fine-tuned models can hallucinate—always verify.

---

### 5. Maintain Your Natural Writing Voice
- Rewrite AI drafts using your authentic tone: conversational, clear, and grounded in real-world examples.
- Avoid technical jargon unless absolutely necessary for the audience.

---

### 6. Reserve Strategic Sections for Human Authorship
- Executive Summary
- Key Recommendations
- Industry Trends and Predictions
- Calls to Action (CTAs)

Only you can provide the nuanced perspective that establishes real thought leadership.

---

### 7. Audit for Authenticity
- Conduct a final review asking: **"Does this sound like me?"**
- Rewrite anything that feels too robotic or generic.
- Add anecdotes, practical takeaways, and lessons learned to humanize the final draft.

## Closing Thought

Custom GPTs can speed up drafting and formatting, but your expertise must lead every step of the way.  
**Your expertise drives. AI simply builds the road faster.**
