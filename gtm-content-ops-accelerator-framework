# GTM Content Operations Accelerator Framework
*(30/60/90-Day Plan for Cloud, Cybersecurity, and GovTech SaaS Teams)*

## Objective
Accelerate GTM velocity by embedding a lightweight, scalable content operations system aligned directly to pipeline growth, buyer enablement, and launch success.

## First 30 Days: Foundation & Quick Wins
- Conduct a content systems audit (existing assets, gaps, reuse opportunities).
- Meet with Sales, Product, and Customer Success to surface frontline pain points.
- Launch a content pipeline tracker (Notion or equivalent) mapped to active deals and launches.
- Publish internal quick wins:
  - Updated battlecards
  - Simplified solution briefs
  - Top 5 FAQs from sales calls turned into sharable content

## Next 30 Days (60-Day Mark): Enablement Alignment
- Build modular content templates for repeatable use (case studies, whitepapers, gov proposals).
- Partner with Sales to align content drops to active pipeline stages (not blog-first content calendars).
- Launch a content-request intake form to prioritize impact-based creation, not random asks.
- Establish a feedback loop with GTM teams to tune messaging in real time.

## Final 30 Days (90-Day Mark): Scaling Systems
- Create a lightweight editorial operations guide so content scaling doesn't break workflows.
- Launch a content reuse library (slides, snippets, battlecards) for Sales and CS teams.
- Build first content ops dashboard showing content contribution to pipeline velocity and deal acceleration.
- Position content ops as an enabler of faster launches and shorter sales cycles, not overhead.

## Result
Revenue-centric content ops that reduces sales friction, accelerates GTM readiness, and extends the life of every piece of content produced.
