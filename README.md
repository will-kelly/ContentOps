# ContentOps playbook

Battle‑tested templates for shipping content that actually moves the revenue needle—no fluff, no gatekeepers.

## Why this repo exists

Most “content operations” advice is either vague theory or buried in decks you’ll never find again. This repo open‑sources the checklists, forms, and frameworks I use with clients so you can ship better content faster.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/will-kelly/ContentOps.git
cd ContentOps
open ./<framework>.md   # pick the file you need
````

All files are Markdown for maximum portability. Everything is released under CC0‑1.0—fork, remix, commercialize.

## Usage scenarios

* **Zero‑to‑one build‑out** – Spinning up content ops at a startup? Fork these templates, tweak, deploy.
* **Revamp & scale** – Your content machine exists but creaks under growth. Replace brittle docs with these opinionated checklists.
* **Fractional leadership** – Consultants can drop these frameworks into client environments and show momentum on day one.

## Roadmap

* **Q2 2025** – Publish editable Google Docs versions via Docs‑to‑Markdown action
* **Q3 2025** – Add a Notion database template mirroring this repo’s structure
* **Ongoing** – Dog‑food each framework in client work and update with lessons learned
