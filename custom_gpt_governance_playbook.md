# Implementing a Custom GPT Governance Framework

**How to deploy, manage, and sustain custom GPTs without losing control of your editorial standards, security posture, or content integrity.**

---

## Governance Objective

Establish a repeatable, reviewable framework for deploying custom GPTs that support business-critical functions like documentation, support content, and knowledge sharingâ€”while preventing misuse, untraceable edits, and hallucinated output.

---

## Scope of GPT Use Cases

**Covered:**
- Technical documentation (drafting, editing, rewriting)
- Internal knowledge base support (e.g., Notion or Confluence copilots)
- SalesOps and RevOps content generation (FAQs, one-pagers)
- Product marketing material (blog drafts, positioning guidance)

**Excluded:**
- Code generation without peer review
- Legal, compliance, or financial language
- Customer-facing automation unless reviewed by a human editor

---

## Roles and Ownership

**Every custom GPT must have a clearly documented owner.**

- **GPT Owner:** Approves the GPT's scope, config, and deployment  
- **Prompt Engineer / Builder:** Writes and maintains the JSON and system prompt  
- **Reviewer / QA:** Reviews output before it enters a production pipeline  
- **Platform Admin:** Manages permissions, access, and integrations  

---

## Approval Workflow

1. **Proposal submission:** Builder outlines the use case, intended audience, and risk level  
2. **Prompt + config review:** Owner and reviewer inspect for scope creep, hallucination risk, and compliance gaps  
3. **Test run:** GPT must be tested on real content with a QA checklist  
4. **Approval or rejection:** Final decision by GPT Owner  
5. **Documentation published:** Location of config, intended use, limitations, and known weaknesses  

---

## Prompt Documentation and Versioning

- Store all GPT prompts and config files in a GitHub or Notion repo  
- Include:
  - GPT name and description
  - Use case and scope
  - Persona and instructions
  - Last updated by and date
  - Known edge cases or red flags
- Use semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`) to track changes  

---

## Review and QA Expectations

AI-assisted content must go through the same review process as human-generated content.

**Required checks:**
- Fact-check all AI-generated claims and stats
- Check for hallucinated product names or features
- Verify tone and formatting match your orgâ€™s standards
- Confirm that content is labeled if it originated from a GPT

---

## Monitoring and Audit Trail

- Track usage via platform logs or wrapper tools  
- Log deployment date, owners, and config version  
- Schedule quarterly audits of all GPTs  
- Flag any GPTs inactive for 90+ days for review

---

## Security and Access

- Restrict publishing/editing GPT configs to authorized builders and owners  
- Use shared GPT access via wrappers (e.g., internal chatbots)  
- Avoid including proprietary code, credentials, or strategic data in prompts  
- Require 2FA for GPT platform access where available

---

## Deprecation and Sunset Process

1. Flag GPT for removal  
2. Archive config and documentation  
3. Notify users with replacement or workaround  
4. Mark deprecated GPT in platform with **[DEPRECATED]** tag  
5. Remove access or disable endpoint

---

## Enablement and Training

Provide teams using custom GPTs with:
- A quickstart guide for safe GPT usage  
- A list of approved GPTs and access links  
- Training on prompt editing and governance  
- A pre-publish checklist for GPT output review
