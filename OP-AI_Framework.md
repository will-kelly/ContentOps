# OP-AI: A framework for embedding generative AI into real content operations

**Subtitle**: A field-tested framework for deploying generative AI across the content lifecycle without sacrificing quality, clarity, or control

Generative AI won’t save your content operation. But if you build with intent—governed by real workflows and grounded in editorial discipline—it can finally start pulling its weight.

**OP-AI** is a five-phase framework designed for high-performing content teams that need *results*, not just AI experiments. It’s built for strategists, content ops leads, and technical writers who are tired of seeing AI pitched as magic instead of muscle.

## 1. Orient: Audit your content ecosystem for AI-readiness

**Goal**: Identify where generative AI can accelerate, supplement, or derail your workflows.

### Key actions:
- Map your current workflows and contributors across the content lifecycle  
- Identify bottlenecks where AI could assist (not automate): research, briefs, formatting, tagging  
- Flag high-risk areas: technical precision, regulatory content, SME nuance  
- Evaluate team AI literacy by role (writers, reviewers, SMEs, SEs)

### Output:
- AI-readiness scorecard  
- Integration opportunity heatmap

### Tools:
Notion, Miro, Airtable, GitHub Projects

---

## 2. Position: Define your use cases and non-use cases

**Goal**: Align AI with what matters—without wrecking credibility or quality.

### Key actions:
- Classify tasks into three buckets: automate, augment, avoid  
- Create a tiered use case matrix:
  - Tier 1 – Systemic: tagging, summarizing internal docs, metadata  
  - Tier 2 – Tactical: rewriting, repackaging, outlining  
  - Tier 3 – Experimental: net-new drafts, ideation, campaign concepts  
- Document anti-use cases: where human expertise must lead

### Output:
- Use case matrix  
- Approved prompt library  
- AI guardrails doc

### Tools:
Notion database, Custom GPT, ChatGPT Team, Writer.com

---

## 3. Architect: Build the systems and guardrails

**Goal**: Prevent chaos by embedding governance and control mechanisms.

### Key actions:
- Define AI-related roles: Prompt Owner, Reviewer, Final Approver  
- Tag all AI-generated content (`ai-drafted`, `ai-assisted`, `human-reviewed`)  
- Codify tiered review processes based on content risk  
- Integrate AI into existing editorial workflows  
- Track AI involvement for every asset—down to the prompt level

### Output:
- Content governance schema  
- AI workflow playbook  
- Prompt governance and versioning strategy

### Tools:
Notion, Confluence, GitHub, Google Drive

---

## 4. Integrate: Operationalize AI across your tools and team

**Goal**: Treat AI like a junior team member—train it, track it, and measure it.

### Key actions:
- Plug AI into CMS, DAM, and PM tools  
- Build "prompt packs" by content type (e.g., product brief, battlecard)  
- Create onboarding for responsible AI usage  
- Build feedback loops to track effectiveness and accuracy

### Output:
- Systematized workflows with measurable AI ROI  
- Team onboarding kit  
- Prompt effectiveness dashboard

### Tools:
Notion AI, Zapier, Airtable, Jasper, Custom GPTs, Slack integrations

---

## 5. Evolve: Monitor, adapt, and improve

**Goal**: Turn your AI program into a living, learning system.

### Key actions:
- Log content failures and escalations tied to AI  
- Host quarterly prompt audits and playbook reviews  
- Track team AI usage patterns  
- Align with legal, security, and brand teams on updates

### Output:
- Living AI governance doc  
- AI Friction Log  
- Prompt deprecation and upgrade tracker

### Tools:
Notion wiki, Slack `#ai-fails`, GitHub changelog, Loom for async review

## Strategic principles behind OP-AI

- Prompting ≠ strategy. Build workflows, not one-off hacks.  
- Treat prompts like code. Version, govern, and document them.  
- Quality > novelty. AI should extend your team, not replace judgment.  
- SMEs are your differentiator. AI should scaffold, not supplant, expertise.  
- Velocity without accuracy is vanity.

## Who this framework is for

- Tech companies scaling content with lean teams  
- DevOps, FinOps, and AI vendors writing for technical audiences  
- Content ops leaders modernizing editorial systems  
- Writers and strategists who need guardrails, not hype
