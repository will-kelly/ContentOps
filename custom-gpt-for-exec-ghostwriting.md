# Custom GPT for Executive Ghostwriting  
*Streamline voice, tone, and content creation between executives and ghostwriters*

## Purpose  
This custom GPT is built to:
- Replicate an executive’s tone, voice, and communication style
- Assist with creating thought leadership content (LinkedIn posts, emails, speeches, etc.)
- Act as a collaborative writing assistant for writers and execs
- Reduce time spent on drafting, revisions, and approvals

## Step 1: Define the GPT's Purpose and Boundaries  

**Core Use Cases:**  
- Ghostwrite LinkedIn posts and email drafts  
- Translate bullet points and voice notes into long-form content  
- Maintain consistent voice across platforms  
- Suggest edits, variations, and messaging formats

**Boundaries:**  
- Should not publish automatically  
- Will not invent strategic messaging or policy positions  
- Should not respond on behalf of the executive in real-time  

## Step 2: Gather Executive Input  

**Must-have materials:**  
- A tone and voice guide (conversational, formal, witty, etc.)  
- Samples of past written content (emails, memos, posts, articles)  
- Topics they focus on—and ones to avoid  
- Audience profiles (investors, board, employees, public, etc.)

**Nice-to-have extras:**  
- Meeting recordings or transcripts  
- Messaging docs from product/marketing  
- Examples of how they handle sensitive or high-pressure comms  

## Step 3: Build the Custom GPT  

1. Open ChatGPT  
2. Click `Explore GPTs` → `Create`  
3. Set the GPT name (e.g., `ExecVoice Assistant`)  
4. Under “Instructions,” define:
   - Purpose: *"Helps ghostwrite content for [Exec Name] with accurate tone and messaging"*
   - Tone: *"Professional, clear, punchy, sometimes witty depending on audience"*
   - Avoid: *"Buzzwords, passive voice, hedging, filler"*

5. Upload files or paste in text examples to train it  
6. Customize output format (e.g., 300-word post, 5-bullet email summary, 90-second read)

## Step 4: Feedback and Iteration  

**Best practice workflow:**  
- Writer uses the GPT to generate a draft  
- Exec gives feedback (live or async)  
- Writer refines the GPT's prompts or examples  
- Lock in tone preferences to reduce revisions

**Measure success:**  
- First-draft acceptance rate  
- Time to final version  
- Executive satisfaction with tone accuracy  

## Step 5: Scale for Broader Use  

- Clone GPTs for other execs and customize tone  
- Connect to meeting transcripts, calendars, or Notion notes  
- Use for FAQs, earnings prep, internal messages  
- Onboard new writers or comms staff with saved GPT profiles

## Benefits  

- Speeds up content creation  
- Reduces dependency on real-time feedback  
- Maintains voice consistency across platforms  
- Scales easily across multiple stakeholders

Start small with one GPT for a single exec. Iterate with real content. Once it works—scale it.
