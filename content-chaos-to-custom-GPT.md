## About

Your organization already has valuable content—web pages, white papers, decks, transcripts.  
Instead of starting from scratch, you can transform existing materials into **Custom GPTs** or **LLM-based assistants**.

This approach saves time, scales knowledge, and ensures consistent messaging across teams and channels.

## What is a Custom GPT

A Custom GPT isn’t just another chatbot. It's a **smart knowledge worker** powered by your proprietary content.

Custom GPTs can:
- Act as internal helpdesks
- Provide sales enablement
- Guide customer onboarding
- Deliver consistent, context-aware responses

Automate expertise while keeping your unique brand voice intact.

## Identify Your Source Content

Audit your existing assets:
- Sales decks, fact sheets, brochures
- Webinar and event transcripts
- Internal documentation and process guides
- FAQs and support tickets

Prioritize high-value, evergreen content first.

## Clean and Structure Your Data

The quality of your AI output depends on the quality of your input.

Best practices:
- Remove outdated or irrelevant information
- Use clear formatting: headings, bullets, and structured Q&A

## Choose the Right Platform

Select a tool based on your team's needs:
- **OpenAI Custom GPTs** – Fast, accessible, minimal coding

Building a Custom GPT is an ongoing process.

Steps to success:

## Use Cases and Business Value

Implementing Custom GPTs can drive significant business outcomes:
- Faster onboarding for sales and technical teams
